Oscar nominations are usual the resultant of nominations for less prestigious awards (e.g. Golden Globes, BAFTA, Critics Choice, industry awards). A standard linear 
regression model of machine learning is used to predict 2021 Academy Awards nominations based on 4 previous years' nominations.

***Oscars-TrainingData.csv*** contains all data about 4 last years, including nominations for Oscars, Golden Globes and so on. For every movie there is a dedicated number (mostly 0
or 1, sometimes 2) that indicates how many nominations did the film achieved in a given category. This is a training data for the model.

***Oscars-TestingData.csv*** contains the same data about 2021 movies (except for Oscars nominations).

***modeling.py*** is an executable file which enables a user to pick a category and see a predicted nominees.

***preview.py*** is a view from Python Console while executing modeling.py.

After Oscars nominations' announcement (March 15th, 2021) I'll upload a file summarizing accuracy of my model.
